# Scattering

The python script produces the plot.
I deuteriet (H vs D) either the lipids tails, the water and both (total). Im all cases it is 100 % exchanged. 

I get the wrong units for the CG system for some reason. 

The MC3H fully charge no RNA monolayers from CG is backmapped and is in the folder MC3H_backmaped. The final*.pdb file is the output structure. The needed itp files are also there.
